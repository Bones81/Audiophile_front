## Technologies Used

* React (Create-React-App) - front end framework
* Material UI - majority of styling present
* Slick UI - carousel visuals
* Auth0 - user authentication
* Axios - Using our API and Spotify's API

## Approach Taken

* Styling was a continuous effort. Below are other steps we took to create this app:

1. Use Create-React-App as a starting point for our react application
2. Make API calls using axios
3. Build a bare front end, where users can just create, read, update and delete from our API
4. Build our connection with Spotify API
5. Add an option for users to add spotify data to our API.
6. Add authentication feature using Auth0.
7. Finalize styling

## Unsolved Problems

## User Stories

*As a general user, one can visit our site to get music recs based on genre, artist or year
*As an authenticated user, one can edit, delete or add new music recs to the music lists.
